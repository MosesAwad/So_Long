# So_Long
This is a 2D game I designed as part of the So_Long Project at 42 Abu Dhabi. The main objective of the game is to escape the map after collecting all the coins whilst evading patrolling enemies. The player also has the ability to build the elements of the map to their liking as long as long as they respect the rules specified.
